# Simple React User Management

This is a minimal React (JavaScript) app that connects to the provided mock API:

API: https://68a04cea6e38a02c58184c4b.mockapi.io/users

Features:
- List users
- Add user
- Edit user
- Delete user

How to run (locally):

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) and try the UI. 

Notes:
- This project uses Vite — fast development server and modern build tool.
- No TypeScript used.
- The app talks directly to the MockAPI URL and expects typical REST operations.
